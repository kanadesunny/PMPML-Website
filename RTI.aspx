							<td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"  class="Year1 border_left">When a  Government governs a country, welfare of the people is the core of all  its activities. If a citizen is not satisfied with any of the  interventions of the government, he can ask relevant information about  it, using this Act. This helps in making the government more  transparent. Many people are effectively exercising this right. For eg.  the road outside your house has been dug up for several days and is  causing inconvenience. You need to know when the work will end. You can  get this information from the Information officer of the concerned  department. This Act directs that an information officer be appointed  at all levels, from Central to the local administrative bodies, and  information asked for be provided in a stipulated amount of time. The  boards on PMPML and ST buses indicate the destinations and routes which  helps the passengers to choose the correct bus. This is a simple  example of how relevant information can be of use. Similarly, the  information obtained through the Right to Information Act can serve its  purpose. </td>

								<p>The  Right to Information has been implemented by the Central Government  since 2005. Aruna Roy in Rajasthan, started a movement to demand this  right, in the year 1990. This Act was passed in Rajasthan. In  Maharashtra , reknowned social worker Shri Anna Hazare, continuously  raised this demand for the benefit of the society at large. The  Government of Maharashtra realized the need and granted the  implementation of this Act from 2003. Maharashtra with it progressive  background proceeded to lead the other states in this regard. This once  again endorsed that Maharashtra always supports all such  people-centered endeavors. </p>
								<p>The  State government issued the necessary guidelines to all the government  and semi-government bodies about the implementation of this Act. In  2004, Yashwantrao Chavan Academy for Development Administration,  YASHADA, an apex training Institute of the Government was given the  responsibility of all the training related to the Right to Information  Act. </p>
