								<p>Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporations recognises the need for creation of safe, affordable and world class bus rapid transit infrastructure and services, with focus on commuter comfort and convenience, integration of modes and information technology, thus focussing towards a livable and sustainable future. Rainbow BRT serves as an alternative mobility solution for making an accessible Pune Region.</p>
								<br />
								<p>The Rainbow BRTS project is being implemented with the financial support of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) of the Government of India. Additionally, specific components of the project in Pimpri Chinchwad are being funded under the ‘Sustainable Urban Transport Project’, which is an initiative of the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India and is supported by The World Bank, UNDP & GEF.</p>

								<p>
									<br />
									BRT is not about moving buses but ‘Moving People’ in a high quality system.
								</p>
								<p>Bus Rapid Transit provides an integrated network of safer, faster, affordable and more efficient public transport. Enabling a safe and comfortable interface between the infrastructure and passengers, BRTS operates on dedicated lanes providing quick access across the city. </p>
								
								<p>The concept of the BRTS took its birth in Curitiba in mid 1970s. Ever since, it has been constantly evolving and expanding across the globe. Today, BRT is considered to be a smart public transport system driven by features and technology, and often considered to be an alternative to metro rail due to its low cost, high capacity and quick implementation period.</p>
